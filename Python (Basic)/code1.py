#
#Implement a function that:
#1. Is named avg
#2. Takes a variable number of integer arguments; it is guaranteed that at least one argument will be passed
#3. Returns the average value of the passed arguments as a float

#The implementation will be tested by a provided code stub on several input files. Each input file contains one line with space-separated arguments for the function. The function will be called with those arguments, and the returned result will be printed to the output with exactly 2 decimal places.

#Example 
#3 arguments are read and passed to the function: 1, 2, and 3. The average is calculated to be (1 + 2 + 3) / 3 = 2.00. This is then returned as a float to be printed.

#Constraints
#• 1 ≤ number of arguments for the function ≤ 100
#• -100 ≤ value of passed arguments < 100
